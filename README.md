# Maze-Solver
This Java application reads maze configurations from a text file and solves them using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. It dynamically identifies start (S) and goal (K) points, navigates around obstacles (O), and outputs the shortest solution path. Easily customizable for various maze layouts.
